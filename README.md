# database creation


Whenever you start a project, there are two things that you need to keep in mind â€” Scalability and Performance.
If your database is not capable enough to handle the bulk of data and the number of users, it can lead to serious issues like latency, crash, imbalance and so on. Hence, choosing the right database is a very important step in any project.
Therefore, when choosing a relational database for your project, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind:

1). Scalability: The database that you select should be capable enough to handle the bulk of data and number of users. The scalability refers to how well it can scale as your project grows. It should be able to scale vertically and horizontally, depending upon the requirement.

2). Availability: Availability refers to how reliable the database is or how often it is up and running. The more stable and consistent the database is, the better it is.

3). Durability: Durability refers to how well it can handle failures or crashes. The more robustly it handles failures or crashes, the better it is.

4). Query Capabilities: Query capabilities refer how well can it perform complex queries to retrieve data from different tables within seconds. The faster it performs queries, the better it is.

5). Maintenance: Maintenance refers to how easy or difficult it is to maintain and manage this database across servers or devices. The easier it is to maintain, the better it is.

6). Cost: Cost refers to how expensive or inexpensive this database is compared to other available options in the market.
